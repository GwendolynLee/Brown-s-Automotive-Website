# Brown-s-Automotive-Website

This website was built using Bootstrap v4.3.1.  I wanted this to be more responsive and the Bootstrap features seemed to work well.

A few tweaks still need to be implemented.  For instance, the main text needs to be responsive to small device sizes.  Also, there is a white space on the right size for some of the smaller phone sizes.  I need to find what is causing that.
